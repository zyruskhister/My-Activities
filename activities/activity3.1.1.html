    <h1>Out-of-This-World Travel Tips</h1>
    <p>Still thinking of a summer vacation? Better get a move on. We scanned the Web for some of the more unusual vacation ideas out there. And some are really out there.</p>


    <h2>Dolphin Encounters</h2>
    <p>Want to commune with intelligent beings from another world? Try swimming with dolphins. Here is one outfit in the Bahamas that offers the experience - with trained, not wild, dolphins. <a href="http://www.dolphinswims.com" target="_blank">www.dolphinswims.com</a></p>


    <h2>The Skydivin' Place</h2>
    <p>Take a skydiving vacation. This Maryland skydiving company has rigged its home page to play a pinging rendition of the Tom Petty song Free Fallin'. Cute. <a href="http://users.supernet.com/smithja/index.html" target="_blank">Link to the site</a></p>


    <h2>Dude Ranches</h2>
    <p>Horseback getaways for city slickers are plentiful. Mosey on over to this site to find links or phone numbers for 500 dude ranches around the United States and Canada, including one listing in Hawaii. You can also submit your resume for a dude-ranch job. <a href="http://www.duderanches.com" target="_blank">www.duderanches.com</a></p>


    <h2>Running of the Bulls</h2>
    <p>Entertain your death wish. It's too late for this year, but you can make plans for next summer's run in Pamplona, Spain, by visiting this site - which has details for surviving the whole Fiesta of San Fermin. It contains detailed instructions on how to survive. For example: "Making the run on a drunken spree is totally out of order." <a href="http://www.sanfermin.com/index_eng.html" target="_blank">www.sanfermin.com</a></p>
